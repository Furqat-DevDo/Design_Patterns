 Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
 but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

 The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) 
 with calls to a special factory method. The objects are still created via the new operator, 
 but it’s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are
 often referred to as products.


 There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products
 have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type 
 declared as this interface.

 1. The Product declares the interface, which is common to all 
 objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.

 2. Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface.

 3. The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. 
 It’s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.
 You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. 
 As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type.
 Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary responsibility of the creator. 
 Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. 
 The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes.
  
 4. Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.

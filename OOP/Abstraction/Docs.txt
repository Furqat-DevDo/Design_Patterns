Abstraction is a model of a real-world object or phenomenon,
limited to a specific context, 
which represents all details relevant to this context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.

Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. 
Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, 
you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and 
which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation.

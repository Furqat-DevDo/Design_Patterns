interfaceâ€”a public part of an object, open to interactions
with other objects.

Encapsulation is the ability of an object to hide parts of its
state and behaviors from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program.

To encapsulate something means to make it private , and
thus accessible only from within the methods of its own class.

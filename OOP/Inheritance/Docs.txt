Inheritance is the ability to build new classes on top of existing ones. 
The main benefit of inheritance is code reuse. 
If you want to create a class that’s slightly different from an existing
one, there’s no need to duplicate code.
Instead, you extend the existing class and put the extra functionality into a resulting
subclass, which inherits fields and methods of the superclass.
